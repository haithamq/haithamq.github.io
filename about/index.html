            <p>I am a <strong><u>fullstack veteran</u></strong> who takes solace
                from getting to walk across the borders and experience the other territories every once in a while. I am

                upon large scale enterprise level applications. Having delivered several solutions for the domains
                including Business management and ERPs, educational platforms, finance, healthcare and leisure industry,
                I have gained hands-on experience in all stages of enterprise application development along with the
                ability to understand customer needs, communicate effectively and adapting well to changes in workplace
                environments. Turning ideas into real world solutions is my key strength, which compliments my love for
                learning new technologies and solving challenging problems. I always try to make a positive impact in
                the organizations I work at, both from a technical and interpersonal perspective.</p>

            <p>I am a forward-thinker by nature, love to to code and always open to learning new stuff. I am <a
                    href="{{ site.github }}" target="_blank">quite active on
                github</a> and <a href="http://kamranahmed.info" target="_blank">occasionally blog here</a>. Technical
                skillset has never been a problem for me and I take solace from spending my time testing new platforms

                a venture of Al-Tayyar Group, leading the development of the back-office application. I was one of the
                pre-launch-early hires and I am really proud of what we have achieved over the past two years. I have
                been the key member of the architecture team and I am a major contributor in most of the projects that
                we have; where I have solely and in-team developed some core parts of the microservice oriented setup
                that we have.</p>
